# Contributing
To contribute as a user, please feel free to [Submit an Issue](https://github.com/StephenMP/RestWell/issues) if you have encountered any bugs, unexpected bahaviors, or simply have an idea to improve RestWell.

If you'd like to contribute as a developer, please follow these simple rules

1. Either
    * Submit a new issue outlining what you are going to work on
    * Pick an existing issue to work on
1. Fork the repository (or message me about becoming a RestWell team member and get push rights to the repository)
1. Create a branch with the following format: `YourGitHubName/IssueNumber` (e.g. `StephenMP/703`)
1. Make your code changes
1. Ensure all added code is covered by tests (I will scrutinize this like a crazy mad man)
    * Please ensure that you are following the testing pattern. Please reference existing tests to get an idea of the pattern.
1. When committing changes, please follow the commit message format `git commit -m "IssueNumber : Commit Message"` (e.g. `git commit -m "703 : Added tests around Proxy"`)
1. Push your branch up
1. Submit a Pull Request into master from your branch

I'll be honest with you all, I'm going to be Mr. Party Pooper when it comes to contributions. I want to ensure the project is kept clean, is well tested, and follows existing patterns and conventions to make it easier to pick it up and run with.

Thanks and happy coding :)
